    1 2019-11-10 make all the lists sortable by column
                 see for example mrt:jquery-ui-sortable

    2 2019-11-10 process thoughts should only be available if there is at
                 least one thought (disable if zero)

    4 2019-11-17 when entering in /collect, set the cursor in the Thought
                 field

   27 2019-12- 8 do not delete an action status used by an action
      2019-12-27 action_status should not be editable at all

   28 2019-12-15 review general layout, adding vertical and horizontal menus
      2020- 1- 2 running work: have a menu_side + a menu bar placeholder
                  + each principal theme has its own window

   29 2019-12-15 projects hierarchy icon should be green if there is at
                 least one actionable action
      2020- 1- 2 for now, only the action's icon itself is colored because jqtree does
                  not provide any primitive to associate a HTML element with a node

   30 2019-12-23 projects_tree: projects/actions should have the color of
                 their attached topic

   35 2019-12-31 on overview, minimize all

   39 2020- 1- 1 review the height allocation of the horizontal splitter
                  of the process window to be dynamic instead of being fixed

      2020- 1- 2 icons are changed to minus/close instead of minusthick/closethick

   52 2020- 1- 3 fix close icon display in taskbar (cf. iwindowed.less)

   53 2020- 1- 3 when opening several window with the same template
                  (editWindow typically), shift each new window from the previous

   57 2020- 1- 4 projects_tree: set node opened at creation
                  caution: the behavior is slightly altered when jqtree.css is loaded

   59 2020- 1- 4 save #58 (projects tree display done per tab) in user settings

   60 2020- 1- 4 topics color should be user settings

   61 2020- 1- 4 define color for action_status to be displayed in icons in projects tree
                  -> user settings

   62 2020- 1- 4 server consistency check
                  parent action is a project or none
                  project parent is a project or none
                  all topics, contexts, action status are referenced in db

   63 2020- 1- 4 make sure a project is not ended while all actions are not done

   64 2020- 1- 4 have a template for recurrent tasks

   65 2020- 1- 5 homogeneize all table editions in setup to jqxGrid idem actions_grid
                  have both the edition icons and the context menu - same color

   66 2020- 1- 5 action_status should be hard-coded object (as gtd)

   68 2020- 1- 5 factorize delete confirmation dialog
                  + title bar should be shown active
                  + fix icon
      2020- 1- 9 + center in the parent window (defaulting to the screen)

   69 2020- 1- 5 review background-colors
                  tabs / grid headers / selected row / hover row / right-click row

   73 2020- 1- 7 have edit and delete buttons components
      2020- 1-11  this would let us also homogeneize font color

   74 2020- 1- 8 have a data model on documents: provide classes via transform
      2020- 1-11 it seems that the transform function does not oper on find() cursors :(

   77 2020- 1- 9 have ITree interface

   79 2020- 1- 9 actions_edit: firefox display calendar button is not ok
                  chrome is ok

   80 2020- 1- 9 projects_tree/actions_grid: split the subscriptions per tab
                  with goal of gaining some perfs for each individual tab
                  + same for done/not done

   81 2020- 1- 9 action_edit/project_edit: changing anything should either invalidate
                  the whole cursor, or be reported on the initial object
                  so that reopening the window should display the previously set values
      2020- 1-11 as of date, both project_edit and action_edit publish a message on update
                  + projects_tree handles this message (three times)
                  todo: handle once / deal with update / same for actions_grid

   82 2020- 1-11 review counters publications

   83 2020- 1-11 be able to determine on which tree a project/action should be displayed
                  depending not only of its parent, but also of the parent of its parent
                  and so on

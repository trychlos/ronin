 Todo
 ====

    4 2019-11-17 when entering in /collect, set the cursor in the name field
      2020- 2-21 ok in windows layout
      2020- 4- 3 even autofocus="autofocus" doesn't work in pageLayout

   16 2019-12- 1 delegates crud

   17 2019-12- 1 goal levels crud

   30 2019-12-23 projects_tree: projects/actions should have the color of
                 their attached topic

   40 2020- 1- 1 to_maybe to be done

   59 2020- 1- 4 save #58 (projects tree display done per tab) in user settings

   60 2020- 1- 4 topics color should be a user settings
      2020- 4- 3 or set the colors of a topic may be reserved to a dedicated user role

   62 2020- 1- 4 server consistency check
                  parent action is a project or none
                  project parent is a project or none
                  all topics, contexts, action status are referenced in db

   63 2020- 1- 4 make sure a project is not ended while all actions are not done

   64 2020- 1- 4 have a template for recurrent actions

   74 2020- 1- 8 have a data model on documents: provide classes via transform
      2020- 1-11 it seems that the transform function does not oper on find() cursors :(
      2020- 4- 3 have a try at dburles:collection-helpers to manage the deletable status
                 of a context or a topic

   77 2020- 1- 9 have ITree interface

   81 2020- 1- 9 action_edit/project_edit: changing anything should either invalidate
                  the whole cursor, or be reported on the initial object
                  so that reopening the window should display the previously set values
      2020- 1-11 as of date, both project_edit and action_edit publish a message on update
                  + projects_tree handles this message (three times)
                  todo: handle once / deal with update / same for actions_grid
      2020- 3-17 see also todo #195

   83 2020- 1-11 be able to determine on which tree a project/action should be displayed
                  depending not only of its parent, but also of the parent of its parent
                  and so on
                  - starting from any project, it is set in the 'future' tab as soon as it
                     is marked as 'future' - all its children are kept attached to it
                  - this is easy as long as the loading cursor is rightly ordered
                     (root first, future first)

   93 2020- 1-17 check that project's parent hierarchy does not loop
      2020- 3-28 extend the #92 which is closed

   95 2020- 1-18 header_panel: menubar display should be dynamic (have a media query)

  102 2020- 1-23 when changing touch to desktop layout and back, list grows
                  (e.g. on collect page)

  104 2020- 1-23 mobile_footer bar is not visible without scrolling on browser's tablet
                  (miss the url bar and the tabs heights)

  137 2020- 2-11 set mail-based new account enrollment rules

  195 2020- 3-17 pub/sub paradigm let the UI updates itself when another composant
                 has changed. But this paradigm is only applyable to the local client
                 e.g. closing a window when the item has been deleted from another
                 window.
                 In order the updates be propagated to other clients, we have to go
                 through the db collections.
                 - have the message + maybe a counter
                 - have params because these detail what has been modified
                 - make this db collection reactive.
                 This todo aims at replacing some or all ronin.ui.xxx messages.

  201 2020- 3-18 display a spinner when projects_tree is refreshed
      2020- 3-21 not sure this is really needed

  208 2020- 3-22 replace menu_bar / menu_side with gtd_menu + extend to overview

  209 2020- 3-23 have a GAction-like interface ?
      2020- 4- 3 as a reminder, the goal is to be able to desactivate an action (say, 'new thought')
                 and have all html/js implementations reflect this desactivation

  219 2020- 3-28 projectsList in pageLayout: when not signed, the 'new' button
                 should be disabled

  220 2020- 3-28 /actions/edit: leave a trace in g.back, but shouldn't
      2020- 3-30 review and systematise the g.back management -> see History

  221 2020- 3-28 setup in pageLayout: should have a plus button

  222 2020- 3-28 pageLayout when not signed-in, the plus button should be disabled

      2020- 4- 1 plus check usage of g.store

  227 2020- 4- 3 choose and homogeneize pubsub vs amplify publication/subscription

  228 2020- 4- 3 status & device informations: have a tabbed window

  229 2020- 4- 3 would have a tool to display the component hierarchy
                 which should be something like gtd <-> route -> group -> window -> components tree
                 first goal is to make sure all panels have wsf-content class

  230 2020- 4- 3 package candidate: ronin-common usable from both client and server

  231 2020- 4- 3 have a global var 'Ronin' embeds current 'g'

  232 2020- 4- 3 spinner doesn't stop when there is no data (which may be the root cause of #216)

  233 2020- 4- 3 move action_status_select component to ronin-action-status package

      2020- 2- 8 done

  107 2020- 1-26 replace collect_new with collect_edit
                  passing the object via collect.thought session variable
      2020- 1-30 done: have two routes which make use of the same collectEdit window

  108 2020- 1-27 in page Layout, collectEdit is only used to run thoughtEdit
                  see if they may be factorized ?
      2020- 1-30 no, as first in the window part and later is only a component

  109 2020- 1-28 in windowLayout, pass the group to the IWindowed newly created window
                  (idem what happens in pageLayout)
      2020- 2-16 done

  110 2020- 1-30 add a ok message in page layout after update/create items
      2020- 1-30 done

  111 2020- 1-30 deprecate errors component in favor of message
      2020- 1-30 done

  112 2020- 1-30 have the model code in a single place
      2020- 1-30 moved to collectPage (+have to manage async code result...)

  113 2020- 1-31 collectList and collectEdit windows should be renamed as
                  thoughtsList and thoughtEdit
      2020- 2- 1 done

  114 2020- 2- 1 fix wsf-footer display
      2020- 3-28 is fine as of v20.03.27.1

  115 2020- 2- 1 projects_tree: review contextual menu and edit/delete links
                  in case of a page-based layout
      2020- 2-24 page layout: context menu doesn't work => do not account for it
      2020- 3- 7 disabled in all usages when in pageLayout

  116 2020- 2- 1 merge body+page_layout+window_layout into a single body_layout layout
      2020- 2- 2 done to appLayout

  117 2020- 2- 1 make the not_found page responsive
      2020- 2- 2 done

  118 2020- 2- 1 have a link on the web site to download the apk
      2020- 3-15 the n-1 APK is available at /res/apk public url
      2020- 3-31 done

  119 2020- 2- 1 have in the apk a function to detect and download a new version
      2020- 3-12 useless: the apk client automatically updates itself (thanks to Meteor hot-code push)

  120 2020- 2- 3 window layout: unable to open two windows of the same group
      2020- 2- 3 fixed by forcing the data context to be a reactive var

  121 2020- 2- 3 window layout: resizing back the window no more works
                  note that there is no need for settingsPrefix to be in global gtd
                  this, plus the classname prefix, may be, in iwindowed defaults
      2020- 2- 3 fixed

  122 2020- 2- 3 page layout: Thoughts footer tab no more works
      2020- 2- 4 fixed

  123 2020- 2- 3 window title is a bit too right (padding left should be 0.5rem)
      2020- 2- 3 fixed

  124 2020- 2- 3 rename pwi-iroutable-route and pwi-iroutable-mode vars
                  pwi-iroutable-mode is used to identiy the situation where a window
                  embeds a tabbed display, and each tab exhibits its own route. When the
                  window gains the focus, the route should be adapted to those of the
                  currently active tab.
                  1 there is no need for each window template to define itself its
                  iroutable-mode; one may consider that 'window' is the default, meaning
                  that the displayed route depends of the active window; and that the ITabbed
                  interface may itself automatically set the 'tabs' data attribute at creation time
                  2 but one could also systematically send a focus message to a ITabbed child if any
                  (though this may be costly if there are many children without great added value)
      2020- 2- 6 pwi-iroutable-mode is removed
                 pwi-iroutable-route is removed from setup
                 have nonetheless to keep data-ronin-itb-route attribute for each tab
                 done

  125 2020- 2- 6 auto generate routes.js from gtd.js
      2020- 3-21 not sure this is really needed (nor even easily possible)
                 -> cancelled

  126 2020- 2- 8 four main pages are identified for the four gtd features groups
                  what to do with other pages ?
      2020- 2- 8 pages are to be deprecated - replaced with four 'group' pages
      2020- 2-17 no more used pages and windows are deprecated and moved to unused/

  127 2020- 2- 8 deploy.sh also copy last versions from maintainer/www-host/ronin.service
                  and start.sh
      2020- 2-16 done as v20.02.16.1

  128 2020- 2- 8 thoughts ownershipTakeable button doesn't seem to be reactive
      2020- 2-16 yes, it is

  129 2020- 2- 8 publish actions and projects depending of the owner
      2020- 2-16 done

  130 2020- 2- 8 thoughts ownershipTakeable disabled button is not actually disabled
      2020- 2-16 fixed

  131 2020- 2- 8 thoughts ownershipTakeable ownership-owner should not let the
                  button be clicked
      2020- 2-16 fixed: button is disabled or just an icon

  132 2020- 2- 8 both pageLayout and windowLayout have a padding/margin of 0.25rem
                  on top of the content below the header -> mutualize them
      2020- 2-16 both removed :)

  133 2020- 2- 9 window close button in the title bar has title='false'
                  from simone.js, comes from this._i18n( 'close' )
                  try to force the internationalization of the string
      2020- 2-21 obsoleted by todo #50

  134 2020- 2- 9 in window mode, events do not bubble from collapse_buttons to
                  the window (but should) - this is the reason for why we try
                  to use the button pane, but callbacks do not hold Template.instance()
      2020- 2-11 use pub/sub paradigm instead
      2020- 2-11 this is ok and works well - be cautious to not overuse

  135 2020- 2- 9 because header_panel and footer_panel rely on fhsf- classes,
                  the corresponding templates should be fhsf_ prefixed
      2020- 2-16 done

  136 2020- 2- 9 because collapse_buttons relies on wsf- classes, the template
                  should be wsf_ prefixed
      2020- 2-16 done

  138 2020- 2-11 footer_panel have a margin left and right
      2020- 2-16 done

  139 2020- 2-12 when entering the application with a route, gtd.id is not
                  set and then we are unable to compute the template to be rendered
                  + the same will be true each time the user change manually the route
                  + the same when we programatically change the route
      2020- 2-16 should be fixed as of current version

  140 2020- 2-15 on user sign-in/sign-out, the displayed lists should be reactively updated
      2020- 2-25 thoughtsList is OK - projectsList is OK - actionsList is OK
      2020- 2-25 done

  141 2020- 2-15 Thoughts check-list
	               - is list rightly filtered on currently logged-in user ?
	               - are all listed articled actually editable ? (generally speaking, yes)
      2020- 2-16 done

  142 2020- 2-16 project select default placeholder is 'a new project', but may be an action
      2020- 2-17 there is now a 'None' project which prevents that

  192 2020- 3-11 when collapsing an element, removing class and adding class
                 should happen in the same event (to appear more reactive)
      2020- 3-11 this is not possible as closing an element involves only removing
                 class while opening an element also involves adding class
                 so we have to deal with two different actions
                 -> cancelled

  194 2020- 3-11 in windowLayout, opening both an action new and an action edit

  199 2020- 3-17 projects_list/actions_list: stop spinner as soon as the current tab
                 is ready
      2020- 3-18 done for actionsList, projectsList does not seem to need that

  200 2020- 3-18 1. edit action from review -> 2. unable to open new action

      2020- 3-28 try lintOptions in build-extras.gradle, but is not enough
                 seems that the consequence would be that the android client doesn't update itself
      2020- 4- 3 fixed with the permission to use clear text traffic

      2020- 3-26 duplicate of #26

  214 2020- 3-25 tabbed windows: when activating an item side, the route is updated
                 but the active tab is not switched
      2020- 3-26 same for all tabbed windows (probably a consequence of scrollingTabs migration)
      2020- 3-27 fixed

  215 2020- 3-25 setupWindow: depending on which action has led to the window creation,
                  the badge may or may not be displayed
      2020- 3-27 not reproductible + text_badge extended to display zero values

  216 2020- 3-25 setupWindowm: spinner may not stop until a tab change
      2020- 3-27 unreproductible

  217 2020- 3-27 projectsList: have projects and actions distinct counters
      2020- 3-27 done + fix actions counter

  218 2020- 3-28 layout menu: rather display the current layout
